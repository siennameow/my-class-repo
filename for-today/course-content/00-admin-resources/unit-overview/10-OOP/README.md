# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview

In this unit, we'll discuss object-oriented programming in JavaScript as we learn about constructors and the prototype chain. **Constructors** are special functions that help us create objects of similar types. **Prototypes** are JavaScriptâ€™s built-in system that allows objects to inherit features from other objects. Additionally, we'll explore Promises and learn how to take full advantage of them.

> **On the Job:** Prototypes are generally considered an advanced JavaScript concept. Mastering this concept will make you a more competitive JavaScript developer!

We'll also cover **test-driven development (TDD)**, which involves writing tests for application features before writing any code. Then we write only the minimum amount of code needed to make the tests pass&mdash;and repeat this process until the application is complete. Among its many benefits, test-driven development helps us write more understandable and maintainable code.

We'll conclude this unit with an introduction to modern class syntax and inheritance. ES6 introduced a `class` keyword, which allows us to create objects that use class structures like those found in other OOP programming languages. Essentially, classes are just constructor functions with more intuitive syntax. They allow us to implement more advanced OOP patterns, like inheritance, without needing to understand every aspect of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance system.

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Create more scalable applications that follow the OOP paradigm.

* Create new objects using constructor functions.

* Add methods to objects using prototypical inheritance.

* Explain polymorphism through method overloading.

* Implement `Promise.all()` to wait for multiple API calls.

* Verify that your code works as intended through the use of automated tests.

* Build applications using test-driven development&mdash;writing tests before implementing functionality.

* Implement ES6 classes to create new instances of objects.

* Extend basic classes with additional functionality.

* Implement multiple classes with different purposes to practice the OOP paradigm.
