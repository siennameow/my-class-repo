# Final Projects

## Overview

Our journey together is coming to an end, but this is just the beginning for yours as a full-stack web developer. For your portfolio, you will want to include each of the three group projects in addition to two or three of your best homework assignments or personal projects. You didn't know then what you know now, so you may want to go back and do some tidying up. Make sure that each project has a professional README outlining its functionality, the tech stack, and the build process including any challenges faced and how they were overcome. 

Welcome to your third and final group project! This project serves as your best opportunity to showcase all the skills youâ€™ve learned throughout this course and collaborate with the community of developers youâ€™ve cultivated over the past six months. Youâ€™ll work with your group to build a performant and scalable MERN stack single-page application that fulfills a real-world need, with a focus on data and user demand.

Good luck!
