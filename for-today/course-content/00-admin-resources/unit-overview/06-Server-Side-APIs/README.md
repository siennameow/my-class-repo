# Server-Side APIs

## Overview:

In a full-stack application, the client (i.e., the front end) makes requests to the server (i.e., the back end) to get data to display to the user. One way the client can request this data is by using the Fetch Web API. The Fetch API can even request data from third-party APIs, like the OpenWeather API.

In this unit, we'll use the `fetch()` method to make requests, parse through the returned datasets, and convert them to HTML elements. We'll explore how this data is typically formatted, how to look for and handle errors that might arise, and more importantly, how to read documentation when working with server-side APIs.

## Key Topics

We'll cover the following topics in this unit:

* [Client-Server model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Client-Server_overview)

* [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON)

* [URLs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL)

* [HTTP GET method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET)

* [HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

* [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

* [cURL](https://curl.se/docs/httpscripting.html)

* [Location API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Explain what JSON is.

* Explain the methods that can be used to request data from the server.

* Explain the difference between a client-side and server-side API.

* Explain the client-server model and request-response pattern.

* Implement and explain the differences between making HTTP GET requests with XMLHttpRequest, jQuery AJAX, and the Fetch API.

* Explain HTTP response codes and handle response metadata with the Fetch API.

* Parse JSON to dynamically generate HTML.

* Explain the benefits and challenges of working with asynchronous JavaScript.

* Explain and implement URL query string parameters.
