# NoSQL

## Overview
In the late 90s and early 2000s, developers began to explore database options that allowed their web applications to handle unstructured data to meet the growing and ever-changing demands of users and address the limitations of the relational model. While these alternative databases existed for decades prior, they didnâ€™t receive the label NoSQL until this time period.  

The structure of a NoSQL database is something other than a table. There are several different types of NoSQL databases, such as key-value and graph. In this unit we will learn MongoDB, a document-oriented NoSQL database. MongoDB documents correspond to a row, or record, in SQL, but unlike rows, documents are analogous to JSON objects. You can see why MongoDB is a popular choice for Node.js developers! 

Rather than object-relational mapping, we will implement object-_document_ mapping, or ODM, with Mongoose.js. 

In this unit, you will learn about NoSQL databases and perform CRUD operations using MongoDB, a popular NoSQL, document-based database. You will also learn to use Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library with your underlying MongoDB database to enforce a specific schema and handle data relationships. Deployment of an application using Mongo Atlas and Heroku is also covered.
