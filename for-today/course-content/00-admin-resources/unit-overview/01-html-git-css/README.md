# HTML, CSS, and Git

## Overview

At the heart of every website is **HTML**, or **Hypertext Markup Language**. As the standard language used to build the structure of a webpage, HTML allows us to define elements like paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.

**Cascading Style Sheets**, or **CSS**, is used to add styling to the elements created with HTML. CSS determines how elements are presented on the page, including font, color, size, positioning of elements, and even animation. 

In this unit, you'll learn how to build webpages that use HTML and CSS to define the structure and style. You'll also be introduced to Git, a version control system that stores your code and its history, as well as separate versions of the code. As the building blocks of web development, these are essential skills and tools that you'll use throughout your career.

* Build the structure of a webpage using HTML elements.

* Add attributes to HTML elements to style the elements or adjust their behavior in various ways.

* Style webpages using CSS's `color` and `font` properties.

* Identify the box model and how it relates to an element's layout and design.

### General

Refer to these resources for additional information about topics covered in this unit.

  * For instructions on how to add an SSH key to GitLab, refer to the ðŸ“– [GitLab Docs on "Add an SSH key to your GitLab account"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#add-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account). **Important**: The SSH key you added for **GitHub** uses RSA. As you follow these instructions, in Step 1, it's very important to replace `ED25519` with `rsa`.
