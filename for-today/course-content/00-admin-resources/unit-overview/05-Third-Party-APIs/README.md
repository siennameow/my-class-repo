# Third-Party APIs

## Overview

When developers find themselves repeating a task, they tend to look for a way to simplify their workflow. We saw earlier how CSS frameworks were developed to ensure consistency across applications and to expedite developer workflows. Tools with similar goals have emerged in the JavaScript ecosystem. 

jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling. It allows us to write fewer lines of code than if we were using plain old JavaScript. jQuery also provides a number of methods for animations and working with APIs.

Some developers might point out that jQuery is slowly being phased out and replaced with front-end frameworks such as React. It's true that you might not see as many job listings for jQuery developers specifically, but the library is still widely used in both new and legacy code&mdash;so it's an important skill to acquire.

## Key Topics

We'll cover the following topics in this unit:

* [jQuery](https://api.jquery.com/)

  * [DOM traversal and manipulation](https://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/)

  * [Event handling](https://api.jquery.com/category/events/)

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

* [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com)

* [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/demos/)

* [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/)

  * **Note**: `Moment.js` has historically been the most popular date/time library but is no longer supported by its developers. We will still cover it in this unit, but look under the "Resources" section below for other alternatives.

## Learning Objectives

You'll be employer-competitive if you can do the following: 

* Explain and implement CDNs to leverage third-party APIs like CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries, and custom fonts.

* Use jQuery to perform DOM manipulation and traversals and implement interactivity using event handlers.

* Explain how to resolve issues related to dynamically generated HTML using jQuery.

* Explain and implement the Bootstrap grid layout in HTML.

* Integrate Bootstrap components in HTML files to quickly build user interfaces.

* Add custom styling to a CSS framework.

* Implement jQuery UI to make a webpage more user-friendly.

* Use Moment.js to format dates and calculate time differences.
