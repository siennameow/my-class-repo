# JavaScript

## Overview

We've already explored how to structure webpages with HTML and style them with CSS. This week, with the help of JavaScript, we will learn how to make webpages dynamic.

**JavaScript** is a widely used scripting language that adds functionality and interactivity to a webpage. Building on a static HTML framework and CSS styling, with JavaScript you can store information in variables, manipulate your HTML, respond to an event, play audio and video, add decision-making to your code, and do much more. 

As the only programming language native to web browsers, JavaScript is used all over the web&mdash;making it a crucial skill in your toolbox. But Javascript development skills are also versatile. Once you have mastered JavaScript, it is much easier to pick up the fundamentals of other programming languages.

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to: 

* Implement complex decision-making in your code using `if` and `if-else` statements. 

* Explain the difference between equality (`==`) and strict equality (`===`). 

* Store related data in an array and use array methods to mutate and perform operations on the array. 

* Explain functions and how they are used in JavaScript.

* Explain the difference between function declarations and function expressions. 

* Recognize whether a variable is locally or globally scoped and explain the difference.

* Create objects and use object methods. 

* Use the keyword `var` to declare a variable.
